#### How to build your program
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used Maya to implement spheres, grass, constellation textures, etc. It was possible to efficiently generate various 3D objects through Maya and Unity interlocking systems.

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unity was used to align the object with layout and to implement the functions required for the program. We implemented various interventions such as smooth screen movement, laycast, zoom in/out, fade in/out, etc.

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted two user tests. Through user test, I could get positive feedback that I understood the program, had no difficulty in using it, and had a neat design. However, there was a lack of diversity in content, and I also received feedback that it would be nice to support Korean. We adjusted the direction of development by reflecting some of these feedbacks, and we decided to refer to them in future research in the future.

### (3) Conclusion

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our project was expected to embody with leap motion. Firstly, we have realized the project skills with the keyboard and mouse. And then leap motion skills were required. However, because of technical and time constraints, we could not handle about this subjects. That is the biggest limitation of our project. 
      
      
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there are some limitations from user test. Some contents are insufficient to play, such as constellations are too close together in constellation mode, so it makes hard to get signs of each regions. Besides, several users wanted to feel sound and diverse effects (ex. shining stars) for the young target users. 
       
       
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To commercialize our project, other languages are needed, and it would be nice to change the point of view, such as looking at the horizon when the user enters the spread mode.
       
       
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we are going to develop more skills. Diverse of stars and signs are supplemented as well as the interactions. We just made the scroll bar that makes user can show the seosonal changes and GPS settings. It would be great to implement them. Also, we think about voice annoucement services. 
        
        
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we finally success the leap motion based project and supplement diverse skills, this software would be great educational program for young students and for whom are interested in constellation.
