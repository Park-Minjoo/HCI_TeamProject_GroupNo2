### (1) Introduction: Background and goal of your research
### Background
#### We found it difficult to see the constellations due to urbanization and some problems of textbook-based constellation education. Because of the lighting that doesn't go out at night due to urbanization, children no longer have the chance to see the beautiful stars in the night sky. We have developed a constellation education program to provide opportunities to actually see numerous constellations in the night sky, rather than to check out flat constellations in books or textbooks. To maximize user interaction, our program wanted to use Leap Motion devices to increase the effectiveness of constellation training.

### Purpose of the program
####  - Make it interesting to be interested in the night sky and constellations.- Reveals myths and origins related to the location of constellations in the night sky.
####  - Make sure you know what your birthday sign is.
####  - Create your own constellation and develop your creativity.
####  - It makes you feel the beauty of constellations in the night sky by making you feel like you are actually looking at the night sky.

### (2) Main contents

#### How to build your program
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used Maya to implement spheres, grass, constellation textures, etc. It was possible to efficiently generate various 3D objects through Maya and Unity interlocking systems.

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unity was used to align the object with layout and to implement the functions required for the program. We implemented various interventions such as smooth screen movement, laycast, zoom in/out, fade in/out, etc.

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted two user tests. Through user test, I could get positive feedback that I understood the program, had no difficulty in using it, and had a neat design. However, there was a lack of diversity in content, and I also received feedback that it would be nice to support Korean. We adjusted the direction of development by reflecting some of these feedbacks, and we decided to refer to them in future research in the future.

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[시작화면]
##### - 별똥별이 떨어지는 밤하늘 일러스트를 통해 별자리를 보러가는 느낌을 주었다.
##### - 화면 페이드아웃을 통해 자연스럽게 메인화면으로 넘어가게 구성하였다.

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Observing constellation 실행]
##### - SignZONE 프로그램의 메인기능인 Observing Constellation은 Spread Mode와 Constellation Mode로 구성되어있다.
##### - 기능 선택시 defalut 값으로 Spread Mode가 선택되어 실행된다.

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Spread Mode & zoom in/out]
##### - Spread Mode에서는 수 많은 별이 밤하늘에 흩뿌려진 모습을 관찰할 수 있어 마치 사용자가 밤하늘을 보고 있는 듯한 착각을 준다.
##### - 줌인아웃을 통해 보고싶은 별을 확대 또는 축소해서 볼 수 있다.

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [별자리 설명보기]
##### - 별자리가 화면 중앙에 위치하게 되면 별자리가 활성화되어 해당 별자리의 일러스트와 설명을 확인할 수 있다.
##### - 활성화되지 않은 별자리는 불투명하게 보여 사용자는 별자리의 형태 및 일러스트를 동시에 확인할 수 있다.

### (3) Conclusion

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our project was expected to embody with leap motion. Firstly, we have realized the project skills with the keyboard and mouse. And then leap motion skills were required. However, because of technical and time constraints, we could not handle about this subjects. That is the biggest limitation of our project. 
      
      
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there are some limitations from user test. Some contents are insufficient to play, such as constellations are too close together in constellation mode, so it makes hard to get signs of each regions. Besides, several users wanted to feel sound and diverse effects (ex. shining stars) for the young target users. 
       
       
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To commercialize our project, other languages are needed, and it would be nice to change the point of view, such as looking at the horizon when the user enters the spread mode.
       
       
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we are going to develop more skills. Diverse of stars and signs are supplemented as well as the interactions. We just made the scroll bar that makes user can show the seosonal changes and GPS settings. It would be great to implement them. Also, we think about voice annoucement services. 
        
        
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we finally success the leap motion based project and supplement diverse skills, this software would be great educational program for young students and for whom are interested in constellation.
